## **PokéDex Explorer**

**PokéDex Explorer** is a responsive, API-driven web application that consumes data from a RESTful Pokémon API using asynchronous JavaScript. It dynamically renders Pokémon cards, supports search-by-ID functionality, and displays detailed stats, types, and attributes through interactive hover-based UI components. The project demonstrates asynchronous data fetching, DOM manipulation, state management, and responsive UI design.
